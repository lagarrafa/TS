# 🛠️ Troubleshooting Guide Repository

## Overview
This repository serves as a structured knowledge base for troubleshooting common IT issues. It provides a systematic approach to problem-solving, categorized by hardware, software, and networking problems.

## 🔍 Troubleshooting Process

### 1) Identify the Problem

✅ **Gather information:**
- Ask the user: What issue are they facing? When did it start? Any recent changes?
- Check logs and error messages: System logs, application logs, event viewer, etc.
- Reproduce the issue: Can you recreate the problem in a controlled environment?

✅ **Categorize the issue:**
- **Hardware:** Disk failure, overheating, connectivity issues.
- **Software:** Application errors, misconfigurations, updates.
- **Network:** Slow performance, timeouts, dropped connections.


### 2) Establish a Theory of Cause

✅ **Analyze symptoms and list possible causes:**
- Is it a hardware failure? (e.g., disk errors, bad sectors, overheating)
- Is it a software issue? (e.g., updates, compatibility issues, misconfiguration)
- Is it a network problem? (e.g., high latency, DNS failure, IP conflicts)

✅ **Prioritize based on probability:**
- If a problem occurred after an update → Check software compatibility.
- If multiple users are affected → Check network or server-side issues.
- If only one device is affected → Check local system settings.


### 3) Test and Verify the Theory

✅ **Use diagnostic tools:**
- **Network Issues:** Ping, Traceroute, Netstat.
- **Performance Issues:** Task Manager, htop (Linux), Resource Monitor.
- **Storage Issues:** Disk Utility, SMART tools.
- **Logs & Errors:** Windows Event Viewer, Linux syslog.

✅ **If the theory is incorrect → Revise & test another theory.**


### 4) Plan and Implement a Fix

✅ **Choose a safe solution:**
- Temporary workaround (if an immediate fix is not possible).
- Permanent solution (update drivers, replace hardware, reconfigure settings).

✅ **Apply fixes in a controlled manner:**
- Backup data first, if necessary.
- Test on a single system before applying to the whole environment.
- Monitor system behavior after applying the fix.


### 5) Verify and Monitor

✅ **Confirm the issue is resolved:**
- Ask the user to test and confirm normal functionality.
- Check system logs for new errors or recurring problems.

✅ **Monitor for reoccurrence:**
- Keep an eye on system performance.
- Document changes in case of rollback.


### 6) Document the Solution

✅ **Log the issue, cause, and solution:**
- Helps with future troubleshooting.
- Improves team knowledge sharing.

✅ **Update internal knowledge base:**
- If it's a recurring issue, document a step-by-step resolution guide.
